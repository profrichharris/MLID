\title{(Multilevel) index of dissimilarity}
\usage{
id(data, vars, levels = NA, expected = FALSE, nsims = 100, omit = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame with \code{ncol(data) >= 2}. Each row of the data
represents a neighbourhood or some other areal unit for which counts of
population have been made.}

\item{vars}{a character or numeric vector of length 2 or 3 giving either the
names or columns positions of the variables in \code{data} in the following
order:
\enumerate{
   \item the number of population group Y in each neighbourhood
   \item the number of population group X in each neighbourhood
   \item (optional) The total population in each neighbourhood
}}

\item{levels}{a character or numeric vector of minimum length 1 identifying
either the names or columns positions of the variables in \code{data} that
record to which higher-level grouping each lower-lower level unit belongs.
If \code{levels = NA}, the default, then only the standard index of
dissimilarity is calculated.}

\item{expected}{a logical scaler. Should the expected value of the ID under
randomisation be calculated? Requires a measure of the total population in
each neighbourhood. If omitted from \code{vars} that total will be calculated
as \code{sum(X + Y)}.}

\item{nsims}{a vector, the number of random draws to be used for calculating
the expected value. Default is 100.}

\item{omit}{(optional) a character vector containing the names of places to
search for in the data and to omit from the calculations}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{index}. This is a value between zero and one
where 0 implies no segreation, and 1 means 'complete segregation' - wherever
group Y is located, X is not (and vice versa). If \code{expected = TRUE} the
expected value under randomisation also is given. In addition, the object
contains the following attributes:
\itemize{
   \item \code{attr(x, "ols")} an object of class \code{lm}. The OLS
   regression used to calculate the ID. Useful for identifying significant
   residuals (see Example below)
   \item \code{attr(x, "vars")} the names of Y and X in \code{data}
   \item \code{attr(x, "data")} a data frame with the population counts
   for Y and X
}
and also, for a multilevel model,
\itemize{
   \item \code{attr(index, "mlm")} an object of class \code{lmerMod}.
   Fitted using \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}}
   \item \code{attr(index, "variance")} the percentage of the total variance
   due to each level of the model. This indicates the scale at which the
   segregation is most prominent
   \item \code{attr(index, "holdback")} records the percentage change in the
   ID that occurs if, at each level, its contribution to the ID \emph{net} of
   other levels is heldback (set to zero)
}
}
\description{
Returns either the standard index of dissimilarity (ID) or its
multilevel equivalent
}
\details{
If \code{Y} is the number of population group Y living in each neighbourhood
and \code{X} is the number of population group X then \code{id} measures how
unevenly distributed are the two groups relative to one another and is a
measure of segregation. In addition, for geographically hierarchichal data,
scale effects may be explored to examine the scale of geographical
clustering.

The method works by treating the calculation of the ID as a
regression problem: if \code{Y} is recalculated as the share per
neighbourhood of the total count of population group Y
(i.e. \code{Y <- Y / sum(Y)}) and \code{X} is recalculated in the same way
for X, then fitting \code{ols <- lm(Y ~ 0, offset = X)} generates a set of
residuals, \code{e <- residuals(ols)} where each residual is the difference
in the share of Y and the share of X per neighbourhood, and the sum of the
absolute of those residuals can be used to obtain the id:
\code{id <- 0.5 * sum(abs(e))}.

The advantage of calculating the ID in this
way is that it can be extended to consider geographic hierarchies, where
neighbourhoods at the base level can be grouped into larger regions at
the next level, and so forth. Then, for the multilevel index,
the residuals are estimated at and partitioned between each level of the
model \emph{net} of the other levels, allowing scale effects to be
explored.

\code{print(index)} displays the ID value, the expected value of
the ID under randomisation (NA if not calculated), and, for a multilevel
model, the percentage share of the total variance due to each level
(a measure of the geographical scale of segregation: see the examples given
by \code{\link{checkerboard}}) and the holdback scores -
see \code{\link{holdback}}
