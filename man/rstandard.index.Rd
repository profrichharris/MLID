\title{The Standardised resdiduals for the single-level Index of Dissimilarity}
\usage{
\method{rstandard}{index}(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \code{index} generated by the function
\code{\link{id}}}

\item{...}{other arguments}

\description{
Calculates the standardised residuals for the single-level index
}
\details{
The residuals are the differences between the share of the Y population
and the share of the X population per neighbourhood. A positive residual
occurs where the share of the Y population exceeds the share of the X
population, and a negative residual where the opposite. The standardised
residuals can help to identify 'extreme' differences.
