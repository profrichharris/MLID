#' MLID: a package for calculating a multilevel index of dissimilarity
#'
#' Tools for fitting a multilevel index of dissimilarity to geographically
#' hierarchical data. The results measure the two principal dimensions of
#' segregation, unevenness and clustering. The amount of segregation,
#' scale effects and the impact of particular places on the overall index can
#' be assessed. The package development was funded partly under the ESRC's
#' Urban Big Data Centre \url{http://ubdc.ac.uk/}, grant ES/L011921/1.
