## Resubmission
Re. e-mail from Uwe Ligges, March 5th:
I have revised the code slightly so not to call on funtion sigma
and changed to Depends: R (>= 3.3.0) to be on the safe-side

## Test environments
* local Win 10 install, R 3.3.2
* local MacOS Darwin, R 3.3.1
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel) (2017-02-22 r72243)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream Dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
